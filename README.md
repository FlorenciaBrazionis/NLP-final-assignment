## Description

This study presents a hybrid framework for sentiment analysis and topic modeling on Yelp restaurant reviews, leveraging both textual data and structured metadata. We investigate the performance of classical machine learning models, neural networks, and transformer-based architectures in binary sentiment classification (positive: 4–5 stars; negative: 1–3 stars), using features derived from TF-IDF, Word2Vec, DistilBERT, and meta attributes.
